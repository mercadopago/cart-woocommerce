## Customization 

The WooCommerce payment plugin provides flexibility for customization and extensions. You can extend existing functionalities or add new ones according to your specific needs.

### Example Payment Gateway Extension
You can also extend the payment gateway class to add new custom gateways. See an example:
```php
namespace MercadoPago\Woocommerce\Templates\Gateways;

use MercadoPago\Woocommerce\Gateways\AbstractGateway;
use MercadoPago\Woocommerce\Templates\Transactions\ExamplePaymentTransaction;
use MercadoPago\Woocommerce\Templates\WoocommerceMercadopagoTemplate;

class ExamplePaymentGateway extends AbstractGateway {
    // ... (your code here)
}
```
In this example, the `ExamplePaymentGateway` class extends the payment gateway functionality and can be customized to add new payment options.

### Example Payment Transaction Extension

To extend the payment transaction class, you can create a custom class that inherits from `AbstractPaymentTransaction`. See the example below:

```php
namespace MercadoPago\Woocommerce\Templates\Transactions;

use MercadoPago\Woocommerce\Gateways\AbstractGateway;
use MercadoPago\Woocommerce\Transactions\AbstractPaymentTransaction;

class ExamplePaymentTransaction extends AbstractPaymentTransaction {
    // ... (your code here)
}
```
In this example, the `ExamplePaymentTransaction` class extends the payment transaction functionality and can be customized as needed.

You can see more on the github wiki page.

## Running Tests

This project uses [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) for automated testing and generating code coverage reports. Follow the instructions below to run tests and generate coverage reports.

### Requirements

Ensure that all dependencies are installed by running:

```bash
composer install 
```

### Test Commands

To run all project tests and generate HTML code coverage reports, you can use the pre-configured commands in `composer.json`.

- Run all tests:

    ```bash
    composer phpunit
    ```
    This command will execute all tests in the project and display results in the terminal.

- Run a specific test file:
    ```bash
    composer phpunit-file path/to/your/testfile.php
    ```
    This command allows you to focus on a single test file, which is useful for development and debugging.

 ### Code Coverage Reports
 After running the tests, a coverage directory will be generated in the project root, containing the reports in HTML format. You can view the reports by opening coverage/index.html in a browser.

 ### How to mock Wordpress

 To mock WordPress functions and classes in your unit tests, you can use the `WP_Mock` library. It simplifies the creation of mocks and stubs for WordPress functions, allowing you to test your code in isolation.

For more information, refer to the [WP_Mock documentation](https://wp-mock.gitbook.io/documentation).
